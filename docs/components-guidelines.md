## Components Guidelines

#### Components should behave as default html components
When building components keep in mind, that it should behave the same way as default html components.
It means if you have a working default html component, you should only change tag name into zen component and everything will still work as expected. Eg:

```html
<select name="cars" id="cars" @change="myFunction()">
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>
```

can be changed into zen component by just prepending tag names with `zen-`:

```html
<zen-select name="cars" id="cars" @change="myFunction()">
  <zen-option value="volvo">Volvo</zen-option>
  <zen-option value="saab">Saab</zen-option>
  <zen-option value="mercedes">Mercedes</zen-option>
  <zen-option value="audi">Audi</zen-option>
</zen-select>
```

## Emitting events
- **Emit native events** (`click`, `change`, `input`,...) instead of making them up to ensure consistent UX for library consumers.
- **To emit native events** do not use directive `@Event()`. Use `this.host.dispatchEvent(new window.Event('change'));` instead.
- **To document native event** in events table add json doc comment in the `tsx` file right above `@Component` directive: `/** @event change | Called on any selection change */`. Native event need to be documented manually as Stencil can't pick it up automatically.

- Note that majority of these events will bubble up and **you don't need to emit** them manually. Emitting them manually might even be a bad idea because `event.target` will be different (host element instead of the actual element).
- Note also that if `event.composed` is false, it will not bubble out of shadow dom! Therefore events with `event.composed` false need to be emitted manually. An example of such an event would be input's event `change`.

## Props

### Private props
**Private props** should be prefixed by `$` sign (eg. `$updating`).
- Private props are @Prop()s that are used in our composite components such as table. **State** of such prop **is managed by some other component in the composite** and should therefore not be set by the enduser (eg. `zen-row's` prop `$visible`). However user can always read values of such props.
- Props prefixed by `$` will automatically get a `read only` badge in the props table.
- If prop can't be controlled by standard Storybook controls, disable it's controls in the stories with: `argTypes.$visible.control = { type: 'none' };`

### Size properties
- For size variations always use conventional shorthands:
  `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`,...

### Padding properties
Paddings and spacings should always be set to match design out of the box.
Contrary outer margins (spacing between components) should always default to 0!
To determine what is inner padding and what is outer margin:
- If we add some background color to the component. If particular spacing should also have this bg color, it is padding. If spacing should have bg color of component's background, it is margin.

## Writing stories
Template for a new component's story page can be found here:
`/src/components/zen-spinner/template.stories.mdx.sample`

1. When exposing different possible values for a prop, be sure to add `<zen-text variant="label">` beneath each example, so user can quickly see what value is used.

## Documentation
- All **available slots** that component supports should be listed above `@Component` directive like this:
```javascript
/**
 * @slot leadingSlot - Slot placed at the left
 * @slot trailingSlot - Slot placed at the right
 */
```

## Writing Tests

### Visual regression test (VRT)
When you create a new component:
- create new file (copy one of the existing) in folder `cypress/integration/visual/component.e2e.js`
- set correct `pageId` and `stories`
- then run command `yarn test:e2e:update --spec 'cypress/integration/visual/component.e2e.js'` to create screenshots for each story
- commit everything

# Pull request Checklist
- Each native event `dispatch` has doc comment `@event`
- Story with controls includes `logEvents()`
